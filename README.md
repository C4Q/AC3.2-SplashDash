The goal of this game is to cover the most territory with your team’s paint color.

As you run, you drop splashes of paint along your route for other players to see. The faster you run, the larger the paint splatters. If you run into someone else’s route, you paint that part of the map into your team’s color.  This game is designed for people who want to get active, as well as those who enjoy forming strategy on a daily changing field.

### Features

- A sliding view from the bottom to show user's runs ("MY ACTIVITY") as well as the runs of all users from previous days ("ALL ACTIVITY")
- Tap to unfold more information regarding a user's past run in MY ACTIVITY
- A date picker in ALL ACTIVITY where users can see the winners of each day's contest
- A button to show a time-lapse renderering of the day's run in ALL ACTIVITY, whose color corresponds to that day's winner
